# adf2floppy
This work allows you to get a floppy drive and write adf (Amiga Disk Format) files to real floppy disks.

# Implementation
This PCB is based on the schematic published from [Rob Smith](https://amiga.robsmithdev.co.uk/instructions/promini).

Here is a 3d model of the adf2floppy PCB:

And here are a few images of my modded drive writing successfully adf files to a real disk (used a sticker to cover the DD / HD hole):

Hope you find it useful!! :sunglasses:
